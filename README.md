Poker app website
sb= small bblind
bb= big blind

Hello I am trying to create a heads up poker app in html css and java script.

this app will be able to invite a player and select stack sizes and start the game once more then 1 player is connected.

once the game is started dealer button in randomly posistioned.

in headsup poker aka 1v1 dealer in always small blind.

big and small blinds are takin into a pot.

cards get dealt starting with one to bb then one to sb then one to bb then one to sb.

small blind acts first preflop he can fold, call, raise // betting is limited in increments of bb's and no smaller. raising is from 2 bb's to all in. allin meaning all of your stack/chips.

big blind can act after sb and has options of folding, calling, checking, and raising.

bet are either matched or the hand ends and a new one starts after button position is changed, pot is awarded to winner.

one cards is burnt before community cards are dealt.

if bets are matched we go to a flop where 3 community cards are dealt and shared between players to make the best 5card hand.

bb is first to act post-flop he can check or bet.

sb/dealer gets to act next and can check if no bet was made, he can bet if no bet was made, he can call if a bet was made or he can raise if a bet was make and he has enough to raise or is all in for less.

if a bet is made and you dont want to call or raise you can fold and end the hand surrendering the pot.

this betting logic is the same for the next two betting rounds aka turn and river.

once betting/checking/raising/folding is done on flop we can end hand or continue to turn and deal another community card.

one cards is burnt before community cards are dealt.

turn is dealt and bb acts first again..

once betting/checking/calling/raising/folding logic is done we can end hand or go to a river community card.

one cards is burnt before community cards are dealt.

river in dealt and bb acts first betting logic plays out and player either go to showdown to determine a winner or someone fold and hand ends with a surrendered pot.

once winner in determined, pot is awarded.

hand history is saved.

blinds/deal-btn moves.

blinds are takin into pot and a new hands occurs.

game ends if a stack hits 0.
